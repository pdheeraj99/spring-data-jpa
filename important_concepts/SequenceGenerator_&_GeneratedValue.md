## Sequence Name in `@GeneratedValue`

**Original:**

```java
@Id
@SequenceGenerator(name = "student_id_sequence", sequenceName = "student_id_sequence", allocationSize = 1)
@GeneratedValue(generator = "student_id_sequence")
private Long studentId;

**Explanation:**

The `@GeneratedValue` annotation is used to generate values for a field. The `generator` attribute specifies the name of the sequence generator to use. The `strategy` attribute specifies the generation strategy.

In the original code, the `generator` attribute is set to "student_id_sequence", but the `strategy` attribute is not set. This means that the default generation strategy, `GenerationType.AUTO`, is used. The `GenerationType.AUTO` strategy will use the `generator` attribute to generate the values for the field.

In the corrected code, the `strategy` attribute is set to `GenerationType.SEQUENCE`. This means that the sequence generator named "student_id_sequence" will be used to generate the values for the field, regardless of the value of the `generator` attribute.

This is necessary because the `generator` attribute takes precedence over the `sequenceName` attribute. By explicitly setting the `strategy` attribute to `GenerationType.SEQUENCE`, we can ensure that the sequence name is taken from the `sequenceName` attribute.

I hope this is helpful!


I apologize for giving it separately before. I am still under development and learning how to better communicate with humans. I will try my best to avoid making this mistake in the future.
